			<p style='font-size: 35px;'>Tips for School</p>
			<ul style='font-size: 20px;'>
				<li>Maintain a regular studying schedule. Try to avoid procrastinating.</li>
				<li>If you procrastinate, ask yourself why you do. Is it because you dread having to turn in the assignment or is it because you truly need help.</li>
				<li>Study smart, not hard. Study the core concepts and the details can come later.</li>
				<li>Have a growth mindset. Do NOT ever think that you cannot do something.</li>
				<li>Practice is crucial for doing well on tests. PRACTICE, PRACTICE!!!</li>
				<li>That being said, do NOT study for a test. Study to learn and understand. Do it because you want to know and understand, not to just pass the test</li>
				<li>Find ways to make studying exciting! Listen to music, play Kahoot with friends, find a study buddy, get some nice pens, pencils, or notebooks, etc.</li>
				<li>Talking with your teachers really make a different. SERIOUSLY. If you cannot/really don't want to talk with your teacher, tell a trusted adult why, or switch out of the class immediately, because your teacher cannot help you if you do not/can not communicate with them.</li>

			<p style='font-size: 35px;'>Why does Pocket School seem to be less decorative?</p>
			<p style='font-size:20px;padding:20px'>The reason why Pocket School is less descorated than other services/websites is beacuse all of that "decorations" actually distract students. Students need something to be quickly able to access what they need. Pocket School is minimalistic for this reason. If there were more color and deccoration to Pocket School, it would not be very useful for a student, and may even cause some students (like students with <strong>dyslexia</strong>) to struggle. Also, some of the websites that claim to help students focus a lot more on the appearance, rather than the actual functionality of the product. Pocket School hopes to eliminate this problem, and hopefully, it can change the lives of some students.</p>

			<p style='font-size: 35px;'>About the maker of Pocket School</p>
			<p style='font-size:20px;padding:20px;'>Hello, I'm Alison Chiu :). I'm a high school student  in the United States, and I love reading, public speaking, debating, coding (all over the place from mobile, app development, to web design, and pretty much everything in between), coffee, tea, calligraphy, typing (yes, I like to type, I can type pretty fast at about 80 - 120 WPM), hackathons, computers, art, graphic design, fashion, sleeping, Shakespeare, Jane Austen, the list goes on and on... I was really exicted to create Pocket School for the Lighthouse Hackathon, but that is not the real reason why I created it. I really wanted to help students everywhere to be able organize their schoolwork/anything related, as a I've really seen my peers and friends struggle with it, especially throughout the whole pandemic. I know it has been tough on everybody, but we're almost to the end! :)</p>
